### Installing

**Step 1:** Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned `MetaCompare2.0` directory to be made.
**Step 2:** Clone the repository using git command
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/mrumi/MetaCompare2.0.git
```

**Step 3:** Download the compressed Database file from the web server and uncompress it.

```
~/MetaCompare2.0/BlastDB$ wget http://bench.cs.vt.edu/ftp/data/metacompare2/metacmpDB.tar.gz
~/MetaCompare2.0/BlastDB$ tar -zxvf BlastDB.tar.gz
```
*Note:* If you are encountering `ERROR: cannot verify bench.cs.vt.edu's certificate`, execute wget command with `--no-check-certificate` option (`wget http://bench.cs.vt.edu/ftp/data/metacompare2/metacmpDB.tar.gz --no-check-certificate`).

## Running MetaCompare2.0

### Preparing input files

MetaCompare2.0 requires one FASTA file as input and that is assembled contigs generated by a standard assembler. 

### Running

Suppose you have an assembled contigs file, `S1.fa` (*This file is already in your working directory*).

Use following command to run MetaCompare2.0.
```
~$ python metacompare.py -c S1.fa
```
The output should be look like as follows:
```
Running Prodigal
Running Diamond Blastx on ARGDB
Running Diamond Blastx on ARGDB_hh
Running Diamond Blastx on MGEDB
Running mmseq2 on GTDB
```

You can see detailed description for command line options by using `-h` option.
```
~$ python metacompare.py -h
```
